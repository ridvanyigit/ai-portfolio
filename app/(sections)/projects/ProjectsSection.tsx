    title: "Secure & Automated Form Data Pipeline",
    details: `
A fully self-hosted system I developed to eliminate dependency on third-party form services. When a user submits a form on the website, an n8n workflow, secured by a Cloudflare Tunnel, instantly processes the data. The data is archived in a PostgreSQL database, mirrored to Google Sheets for analysis, and I receive an instant notification confirming the outcome of the transaction.

Tech Stack: Docker, n8n, PostgreSQL, Cloudflare.

    title: "Intelligent Web Summarization Tool",
    details: `
Developed a lightweight AI tool that automatically scrapes and summarizes website content using GPT-4o-mini. The system collects raw text via BeautifulSoup, processes it through the OpenAI API, and delivers clean, concise summaries. As an alternative, a fully local, free version was built using Ollama and the Llama 3.2 model for offline environments.

    title: "Multi-Modal Airline Customer Assistant",
    details: `
Built an AI customer assistant capable of understanding and responding through both text and voice. Integrated Whisper for speech recognition and DALL·E-3 for generating illustrative responses, enabling rich, multi-modal user interactions. This project demonstrated real-time processing and deployment of audio and visual models.

  },
  {
    title: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems",
    details: `
Designed and implemented RAG pipelines using both manual and LangChain-based approaches. Constructed semantic vector databases with Chroma and FAISS, optimized retrievers (k=25), and built interactive retrieval workflows for accurate and context-aware responses.

Technologies: LangChain, OpenAI Embeddings, ChromaDB, FAISS, Plotly
    `,
  },
  {
    title: "Price Prediction Platform with Fine-Tuned Llama Models",
    details: `
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict product prices from text descriptions using both classical ML and LLM approaches. Trained a Q-LoRA fine-tuned Llama 3.1 model on 400k Amazon review samples, outperforming GPT-4o and Claude baselines. Integrated feature engineering and evaluation workflows with scikit-learn.

Technologies: scikit-learn, Transformers, PEFT, Bitsandbytes, W&B

  },
  {
    title: "Autonomous Multi-Agent Deal Discovery Framework",
    details: `
Built a production-grade, multi-agent system that continuously scans RSS feeds, evaluates product prices via a hybrid EnsembleAgent, and sends push notifications for promising deals. Deployed fine-tuned models and RAG pipelines on Modal GPU infrastructure to achieve scalable, serverless performance.

Technologies: OpenAI Agents SDK, Modal, ChromaDB, scikit-learn, RSS, Linear Regression
    `,
  },
  {
    title: "Serverless RAG Chatbot with AWS Integration",
    details: `
Developed a full-stack RAG chatbot with a Next.js frontend and a Python AWS Lambda backend. Integrated CloudFront, S3, and IAM for secure hosting. Deployed Bedrock and OpenAI models behind a serverless REST API for scalable and cost-efficient operation.

Technologies: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, AWS Lambda, AWS Bedrock, Serverless REST APIs

  {
    title: "Deep Research App — Modular Multi-Agent Architecture",
    details: `
Transformed a Jupyter notebook prototype into a fully modular research assistant web application. Refactored agent logic into dedicated Python modules (planner, search, writer, email), implemented async generators for real-time progress streaming, and built a Gradio interface for user interaction.

Technologies: Python asyncio, Gradio, OpenAI API, BeautifulSoup4
    `,
  },
  {
    title: "Engineering Team",
    details: `
Simulated a real software development lifecycle using CrewAI with four specialized agents — Engineering Lead (GPT-4o), Backend (Claude 3 Sonnet), Frontend (Claude 3 Sonnet), and Testing (DeepSeek). Sequentially generated design docs, backend logic, frontend UI, and test suites, resulting in a fully functional application.
